# LibreCraft

## Renderer

The renderer uses instances of triangle strips to render block faces.

> The files `include/glad.h`, `include/khrplatform.h`, and `src/glad.c` are from the GLAD OpenGL loader library. `include/stb_image.h` is from the STB library. These files' projects fall under their own licenses, seperate from LibreCraft's.
